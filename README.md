## Introduction 📌

Despite the advancement of tools and technologies, mankind has yet to develop applications to assist visually/auditory/speech impaired people. With the rise of Data Modelling techniques that can be used to infuse “intelligence” even in dumb computers and the ease of accessibility, this “intelligence” can be extended to our Smartphone to help the visually/auditory/speech impaired people cope up with their surroundings and get a assistance in their daily activities. Our Application aims to bridge the gap between them and the physical world by leveraging the power of Deep Learning which can be made accessible even on low-ended devices with a lucid User-Interface that would exactly allow them to better understand the world around.

## Technology Stack 🏁

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

### Building the Code

1. Clone the repository using HTTP : git clone https://github.com/SilentCruzer/Lumos.git
2. Open your code editor (VS Code, Android Studio etc)
3. Click on 'Open an Existing Project'
4. Browse to the directory where you cloned the repo and click OK
5. Let your code editor import the project
6. To install the dependencies run `flutter pub get` in the terminal.
7. Build the application in your device by clicking 'run' button

## Application Preview 👀

## 🏃‍♂️ Why this Project?

Our primary purpose behind this project is to leverage and study how Deep Learning Architectures along with easy prototyping tools can help us develop applications that can be easily rendered even on low-end devices. With this Application, we will develop a one-stop solution to allow the Blind or Partially Blind People to better understand the surroundings around them and to be able to cope with the dynamic world ahead of them. An assistance to deaf/mute people to communicate with others who are not even aware of ASL Sign Language and assist those who are colour blind by helping them to get to know the exact colour of any object.

The Minimal Viable Product (MVP) would allow the Users to leverage Image Captioning Architecture to generate a real-time insight into their surroundings while using Natural Language Processing to speak out in a lucid manner. The cornerstone of the Application would be its User Interface which would infuse a lucid experience for the User with its ease of handling and use.

For this project, we will be collaborating on various domains like:

- Data Modelling
- RESTful API Development
- Prototyping Mobile Application using Flutter
- UI/UX Designing

This would be an enriching experience for all of us that are part of this team.

## How our project is more accessible for visually/auditory/speech impaired people

- Every feature, from image labeling to currency detection uses a text-to-speech feature to speak out to the user whatever is detected 🗣️
- Each screen vibrates with different intensity on being opened helping to user navigate. The buttons also have unique vibrations for better accessibility 📳
- We have used a minimum number of buttons, but whichever buttons are there, are of a large size. For instance, the top half of the screen will be one button, and the bottom half, another button so that a user does not need to precisely click on a particular position 🔘
- All features work completely offline and do not require any internet connection📶
- All offline features work in real-time and do not need any pre-processing time for the models to make predictions so the user can get instant updates🏎️
- ASL Feature uses a simple user interface and so that quick access can be done to all the features and convenient communication can be established between speech/auditory impaired person and a person totally unaware of ASL Sign Language. Also the text to speech feature is implemented to make it usable for person also having auditory impairment along with speech impairment👂
- Colour Blind Feature also continues with a simple and easily accessible UI so that the user can easily get the exact colour which he was earlier not able to see with his eyes👓
